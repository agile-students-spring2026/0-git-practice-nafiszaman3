# What I Find Interesting

Similarly to how we are learning about agile and scrum, I found this article interesting because it seems that Spotify operates their development team in a sort-of similar way. Their team has found a good balance between personalization in their product and experimentation involving their product, particularly when it comes to suggesting new music to users. It's also interesting because it seems that every product that they push has to run through rigorous testing, evaluation, and more before every reaching the user, and this is key in maintaining a good user experience before bugs and unwanted changes spoil that for the user. They bring up the concept of "useful friction," and I found this concept to be interesting and useful for all scopes of development, whether it be a single person producing an application or a large scale tech company like spotify tweaking and updating their platform and product. 

## Comment By Uma Patel

I found this article interesting because it shows how big businesses like Spotify strike a balance between experimentation and careful testing. The concept of “useful friction” was interesting, especially how it helps prevent bugs or unwanted changes from reaching users too quickly. This also related to what we are learned on agile and scrum, where teams continuously test, evaluate, and improve their product while keeping the user experience in mind.
